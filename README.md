Sleep stage classification is an open challenge in sleep research

We use EEG data to classify sleep into 5 stages: Wake (W), Phase 1, Phase 2, phase 3/4 and REM (R)

197 whole-night PolySomnoGraphic (PSG) sleep recordings, containing EEG, EOG, chin EMG, and event markers

Files contain annotations of the sleep patterns that correspond to the PSGs. These patterns (hypnograms) consist of sleep stages W, R, 1, 2, 3, 4, M, ? 

1987-1991 study of age effects on sleep in healthy Caucasians aged 25-101 without any sleep-related medication
